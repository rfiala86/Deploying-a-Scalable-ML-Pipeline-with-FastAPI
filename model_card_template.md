# Model Card

For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
A Logistical Regression model was used   
Model was trained on 1994 Census Data (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income)  
The goal was to predict wheteher a person makes over 50k a year based on other variables (age, education, occupation, etc)  

## Intended Use
For educational purposes: Udacity  
To learn about ML deployment in pipelines  
To predict the salary category of a person based on their features 

## Training Data
Census Data from 1994 was used  
There are 14 Features  
Data is categorical and numerical
